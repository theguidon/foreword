            The GUIDON, Ateneo de Manila University’s official publication, remains steadfast in its commitment of holding the Truth to power amid an era of misinformation. Founded in 1929 by Rev. Frank O’Hara, SJ and first led by Manuel C. Colayco in 1930 as Editor-in-Chief, it has since been a training ground for countless writers, designers and managers in the practice of responsible journalism.
            <br><br>
            In the organization’s 92nd year, The GUIDON strives to bolster community journalism through service-oriented storytelling that amplifies the narratives of underrepresented individuals and empowers the agency of our committed writers, artists, and managers. The publication hopes to venture into journalism that is fearless, balanced, and human-centric by constantly championing the Truth.

            ThePILLARS Publication, the official college publication of Ateneo de Naga University, has been one of the front-line institutions in Bicol serving the people as watchdogs against the injustices and systems violating the aspirations of a democratic society.

            <br><br>
            As we remain in the forefront of the battle for truth and justice, the publication and its committed campus journalists stand to be pro-students and pro-masses in upholding the interests of the Filipino people.

            The Crusader is the official student publication of Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan. Since 1935, The Crusader continues to be the benchmark of student multimedia by being truthful, innovative, and critical minded in informing its Publishers of issues relevant to their needs and interests.
            <br><br>
            The Crusader has since then had over 75 batches of staff members, 75 editors-in-chief, 47 recorded volumes, and countless articles and stories that speak of social truths, inspire critical thinking, and promote the welfare of the student body. Being one of the oldest organizations in Xavier University, even as old as XU itself, The Crusader’s history is lined with many changes, yet its drive to pursue the truth remains unchanged.
