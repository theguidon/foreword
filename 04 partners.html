          <h1>Our Partners</h1>
          <p>To expand our sectoral representation, The GUIDON has invited multiple youth stakeholders to contribute to the Q&A section of the event.  Both Ateneo universities’ student publications and other tertiary student publications are invited. In specifics, the Ateneo Universities’ Tertiary Publications include the following: ThePILLARS Publication (Ateneo de Naga University), The Crusader Publication (Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan), and Atenews (Ateneo de Davao University).

On the other hand, external youth groups are considered given their previous engagements, geographic location and audience reach, and specific or targeted advocacy. The GUIDON strives to be inclusive of different localities, while guaranteeing that there will be no repetition of location and advocacy</p>
