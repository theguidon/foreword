His electoral journey has allowed him to serve in several positions in both the executive and legislative branches of government. His various stints in government have allowed him to carve his niche in the Philippine’s rich political history.<br><br>As a young boy in Manila, Bongbong went to Institucion Teresiana and La Salle Greenhills in Manila where he obtained his kindergarten and elementary education, respectively. Due to his parents’ insistence that he grow up grounded without being overwhelmed by his family’s stature, Bongbong was sent to England where he lived and studied in an all-boys Benedictine abbey, Worth School. Thereafter, he pursued his undergraduate degree, graduating with a Special Diploma in Social Studies from Oxford University in England.<br><br>In his desire to pursue further studies, Bongbong took up Masters in Business Administration in Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA.

Moreno is also noted for his streetwise public image due to his use of colorful language coupled with Manila street slang. As a result, he was catapulted into prominence and is colloquially referred to as Yorme, a verlan backslang metathesis of the English word, mayor, used in Taglish and reversed phonemically as part of Filipino/Tagalog street slang. Whether the word is Tagalog or Taglish, it is the way of reversing or jumbling of syllables so as to create local colloquial words.<br><br>On September 22, 2021, Moreno announced his bid for the Philippine presidency in the 2022 election.', "Images/Candidate6mob.png", "BackgroundImagelink"]]

          <p id="changedes">Looking to avenge his dead father after the Battle of New York in 2012, Rexum vows to never again bear witness to atrocities against the good of mankind. As President of The GUIDON Rexum intends to rule with an iron fist. While other leaders lead with fear, Rexum intends to lead with respect. With regards to the current state of order and governance in the organization, Rexum had this to say, “I have never witnessed such injustice as I’ve seen in the corridors and backrooms of Ateneo’s Online Learning Campus since Loki vaporized my father right in front of my eyes on that fateful day in New York in 2012.” This election cycle has been particularly tough as it not only marks the 10th death anniversary of his father, but also the 4th death anniversary of his mother who passed away at the hands of Ebony Maw’s assault on Bleecker St. in 2018.
